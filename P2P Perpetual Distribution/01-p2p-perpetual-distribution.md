## How to Interact with P2P Perpetual Distribution

Collection holders and developers interact with P2PPD in the following way to verify allocations, inscribe new assets, and monitor ongoing distribution.

### 1. Allocation of Mint Rights
When a qualifying Bitcoin block is mined, P2PPD automatically allocates mint rights to an existing holder through the on-chain allocation process.  
Allocation of mint rights and indexing are both automatic. However, holders must take the action to inscribe the new asset (see [3. Inscribing New Assets](#3-inscribing-new-assets)).

Mint rights remain attached to the authorized parent until used and persist through transfers or sales without expiry.

---

### 2. Checking for New Allocations
After an eligible Bitcoin block is mined and confirmed (+4 blocks), allocation results become visible through the on-chain index.  
Holders can check whether their asset was selected as follows:

- Manual query via the Deployment Inscription using the *Authorization* input field  
- Batch lookup using the [Authorization Script](https://github.com/evonbit/bitcoin-native-systems/tree/main/P2P%20Perpetual%20Distribution/02-scripts) to generate a local list of all awarded assets  

This allows for transparent verification and open sharing of new allocation data.

### 3. Inscribing New Assets
If you hold the authorized parent, inscribe the newly awarded asset following the [Minting Instructions](#minting-instructions) below.  
All validation, rendering, and indexing occur fully on-chain — no team involvement or centralized infrastructure is required.

## Minting Instructions
To inscribe a new asset generated by P2PPD:

1. **Check the Authorized Block Winner**  
   - After block height +4, visit the Deployment Inscription or use the [Authorization Script](https://github.com/evonbit/bitcoin-native-systems/blob/main/P2P%20Perpetual%20Distribution/02-scripts/authorization-script.py) to confirm the winning parent.

2. **If You Hold the Authorized Parent**  
   - Inscribe as a child of the authorized parent  
   - Delegate to the collection’s Deployment Inscription ID  
   - Include undelegated JSON content:
     ```json
     {"blk": 999999, "tick": "collectionticker"}
     ```
     Replace `999999` with the correct block number and `collectionticker` with the case-sensitive collection ticker (e.g. `"natcats"`).

3. **Validation**
   - Only the first valid inscription per block and parent renders.  
   - Invalid or duplicate inscriptions will not render or appear in the on-chain index.

## How to Query the On-Chain Index
You can query the canonical collection index in two ways:
- Manual Query — via the Deployment Inscription’s *Index* input field by specifying a Bitcoin block number.  
- Local Index Generation — using the [Indexing Script](https://github.com/evonbit/bitcoin-native-systems/blob/main/P2P%20Perpetual%20Distribution/02-scripts/index-script.py) to build a complete or partial index dataset.

## Background
Perpetual Distribution is a new **Digital Matter Theory (DMT)** primitive that wraps the DMT **Unique Non-Arbitrary Token (UNAT)** framework and its required indexing functionalities in a fully on-chain system that does not require third-party protocol support.

The UNAT standard, pioneered by **Natcats** in February 2024, introduced generative artwork whose supply and rarity are determined by emergent Bitcoin block data.  

Previous UNAT implementations included the following models and dependencies:  
- **Open UNAT mints** – First-come claims by Bitcoin block ID. These were decentralized in principle but proved vulnerable to bots and unbalanced distribution in practice.  
- **Privileged-authorization UNAT mints** – A central authority issues supply. This model avoids bots successfully but introduces a centralized dependency. It is suitable for initial one-time distributions but cannot guarantee long-term issuance.  
- **Third-party indexers** – Both models rely on external indexers to track supply over time, which also cannot guarantee ongoing operation long term.  

To ensure sustainable, autonomous issuance for collections such as **Natcats**, where supply may continue for decades, a system must support both decentralized issuance and balanced distribution controls.  
**P2P Perpetual Distribution** is designed to meet these requirements.
